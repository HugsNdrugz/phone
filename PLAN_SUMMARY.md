# Summary of Plan Steps (Phases 1 & 2)

This document summarizes the first 6 steps of the comprehensive plan to evolve the launcher towards a One UI look and feel.

## Initial Goal:
Make the launcher feel as close to a real phone (One UI) as possible.

---

### Step 1: Enhance Overall Look and Feel in `style.css`
*   **Summary**: Focused on applying core One UI visual principles:
    *   Implemented robust theming with CSS variables (light/dark modes).
    *   Adjusted typography (fonts, sizes, weights).
    *   Refined spacing and layout (padding, margins, 4dp/8dp grid concept).
    *   Standardized iconography (Material Design icons, sizes, colors).
*   **Status**:
    *   First attempt (Phase 2): **SUCCESSFUL**. Changes committed to `oneui-enhancements-phase1`.
    *   Second attempt (Phase 3, current plan): **FAILED** due to file saving issues with `style.css`.

---

### Step 2: Refine Launcher and Implement Grid/Icon Customization (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)
*   **Summary**: Aimed to improve the launcher's home screen:
    *   **App Grid Customization**: User-selectable grid sizes in Settings, dynamic grid rendering.
    *   **Movable Icons (Placeholder)**: Basic HTML attributes and JS placeholders for future drag-and-drop.
    *   **App Data in JS**: Moved app definitions to `$scope.allApps` for dynamic handling.
    *   **Pagination & Clock**: Refined styling for home screen pagination dots and clock widget.
*   **Status**: **SUCCESSFUL** (Phase 2). Changes committed to `oneui-enhancements-phase1`.

---

### Step 3: Develop a More Comprehensive Settings App (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)
*   **Summary**: Focused on overhauling the Settings app:
    *   **Structure & UI/UX**: Ensured One UI header, styled list items as focus blocks, added "Phone Size" option.
    *   **JS Logic**: Consolidated settings into `$scope.settings`, ensured immediate application of changes (removed "Save" button), provided toasts for feedback.
    *   **Styling**: Custom styling for radio buttons.
*   **Status**: **SUCCESSFUL** (Phase 2). Changes committed to `oneui-enhancements-phase1`.

---

### Step 4: Implement One UI App Bar and Scrolling Behavior (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)
*   **Summary**: Aimed to implement the signature One UI expandable header that collapses on scroll:
    *   **HTML**: Added `.one-ui-header` structure to all relevant app views with `<h1>`/`<h2>` titles and `on-scroll-event` directives.
    *   **CSS (Planned)**: Styles for header states, transitions, and `.scroll-content` height adjustments.
    *   **JS (Planned)**: `xxxHeaderCollapsed` flags, `handleScroll()` logic, and reset of flags on navigation.
*   **Status**: Attempted multiple times. HTML structural changes likely applied. **FAILED** repeatedly due to persistent errors saving `script.js` and `style.css`. Functionally incomplete.

---

### Step 5: Improve App View Styles (`index.html`, `style.css`)
*   **Summary (Planned)**: Further refine visual styling within individual apps:
    *   **Focus Blocks/Cards**: Consistent styling for list items.
    *   **Dialogs and Pop-ups**: One UI styling for dialogs, toasts.
    *   **Input Fields and Controls**: Standardized appearance for inputs, buttons, toggles.
*   **Status**: **NOT YET ATTEMPTED** due to failures in Step 4.

---

### Step 6: Refine Navigation (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)
*   **Summary (Planned)**: Ensure all navigational elements are consistent with One UI:
    *   **Android Navigation Bar**: Styling for bottom nav bar (height, icons, behavior).
    *   **In-App Navigation**: Refinements for back buttons (e.g., chevron icon, placement in collapsed headers).
*   **Status**: **NOT YET ATTEMPTED** due to failures in Step 4.

---

## Overall Project Status Summary:

*   **Successfully Implemented & Committed (to branch `oneui-enhancements-phase1`):**
    *   Foundational One UI styling.
    *   Launcher grid customization.
    *   Placeholder for movable icons.
    *   Functional and styled Settings app with Dark Mode, Grid Size, and Phone Size options.
*   **Successfully Created & Committed (to branch `docs/add-readme`):**
    *   `README.md` file.
*   **Current Blocker**: Persistent failure to save changes to `style.css` and `script.js`, preventing further progress on UI styling (like the One UI App Bar) and behavioral logic.
